## Install git

If you don't already have git, you can download it [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). You must then install git.

## Clone Project

Clone the project from GitHub by running the following command:

    git clone project_url_here

For my project, this would correspond to:

    git clone git@github.com:Nerdylicious/vms-integrated.git

## Install Django and PostgreSQL

If you are installing and running the project on your local machine and not on the Systers VM, then you will need to download and install the following software:

1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) (version >= 1.6.5)
2. [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (version >= 9.3.4)

**You do not need to download and install Django and PostgreSQL if you are installing and running the project on the Systers VM, as Django and PostgreSQL are already included in the Systers VM.**

## Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

The Virtual Machine provided by Systers will be downloaded in a later step. We must first install VirtualBox and Vagrant.

The VirtualBox and Vagrant installers can be downloaded from the following websites:

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Install VirtualBox and Vagrant by running the installers.

## Download Systers Ubuntu Virtual Machine

A Vagrant file is located in the top level directory for the project (at [https://github.com/Nerdylicious/vms-pre-integration](https://github.com/Nerdylicious/vms-pre-integration)) found on GitHub. In case you do not have a copy of this Vagrant file, here are it's contents:
```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don't touch unless you know what you're doing!
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
    config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    vb.gui=true
end
config.vm.box = "systers-vms-dev"

config.vm.box_url = "http://54.183.32.240/vagrant/box/systers-vms.box"

config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host:8001
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
config.vm.network "public_network"

end
```
Save this file as **Vagrantfile** (if you don't already have this file) in the top level directory for the project.

To download the VM, run the following command:

    vagrant up

You must wait a few minutes for the VM to be downloaded completely.

## Using Vagrant

The `vagrant up` command also boots the Virtual Machine.

Once the VM download has completed, upon boot, it may ask you to choose an `Available bridged network interface`. The first option wil work in most cases.

You may come across a message that says `default: Warning: Remote connection disconnect. Retrying...` This message means that the VM is still booting up which is why we cannot establish a connection with it. It is normal to wait on this message for a few minutes (~5 minutes in my case) before we are able to get a connection to the VM. You may need to wait a few minutes until you get a message saying `default: Machine booted and ready!`.

File syncing will work properly after you receive this message: `default: Mounting shared folders`. Please wait for this message before proceeding to the next steps.

Once the VM booted up (and you were able to receive the messages specified above), you can ssh onto the VM by running the command:

    vagrant ssh

You will notice that the project is now synced to this VM by changing directory to /vagrant/vms in the virtual machine.

    cd /vagrant/vms

When you make any changes to the project locally, these changes are also reflected (synced) to the project files located in /vagrant/vms, and vice versa.

Here are some additional vagrant commands that may be useful (which you can try later, do not run these commands right now). Proceed to [Install python-psycopg2 module](https://github.com/Nerdylicious/vms/wiki/VMS-Installation-Instructions#install-python-psycopg2-module).

Once you are done with the VM, exit out of the ssh session by running:

    exit

To put the VM in suspend mode, run the command:

    vagrant suspend

To shut down the VM, run the command:

    vagrant halt

To start up the VM again, run the command:

    vagrant up

## Install python-psycopg2 module

To use Django with PostgreSQL, we will also need to install the python module python-psycopg2. Install it by running this command (this package is not installed by default on the VM):

    sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

## Setup PostgreSQL

We will now setup PostgreSQL by first running the postgres client as root:

    sudo -u postgres psql

Next, we will create a user called `vmsadmin` with a password `0xdeadbeef` (for now) with the permissions to be able to create roles, databases and to login with a password:

    create role vmsadmin with createrole createdb login password '0xdeadbeef';

Next, exit the postgres client by running the command:

    \q

We will need to change the **pg_hba.conf** file to indicate that users will authenticate by md5 as opposed to peer authentication. To do this, first open the **pg_hba.conf** file by running the command:
```
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/x.x/main/pg_hba.conf
```
(where x.x is the version number of postgres)

Change the line `local all postgres peer` to `local all postgres md5`

Also, change the line `local all all peer` to `local all all md5`

After making these changes, make sure to save the file.

Restart the postgresql client:

    sudo service postgresql restart

Now, we will be able to login to the postgres client with the vmsadmin user that we created by running the following command:

    psql -U vmsadmin -d postgres -h localhost -W

You will be prompted to enter a password, which is `0xdeadbeef`

Next, exit the postgres client again:

    \q

We will now create a database called `vms`:

    createdb -U vmsadmin vms;

We can now login to the postgres client for the `vms` database:

    psql -U vmsadmin -d vms -h localhost -W

You will be prompted to enter a password, which is `0xdeadbeef`

To view a list of tables for the `vms` database, run this command under the postgres client:

    \dt

We can now manipulate the database by running the appropriate sql commands under this postgres client.

Make sure to exit the postgres client before proceeding to the next steps:

    \q

## Generate Database Tables Corresponding to Django Models

Change directory to where you can find the **manage.py** file (this is located in the top level directory for the project). If you are installing the project on the VM, the project will be located within the **/vagrant/vms** directory.

To view the sql commands that will be generated from syncdb, run the command:

    python manage.py sqlall app_name_here

To generate the database tables that correspond to the Django models, run the command:

    python manage.py syncdb

We do not want to create a superuser at this time, so when it asks you to create a superuser, say 'no':

    You just installed Djano's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
    Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): no

Check that the tables were created by starting the postgres client and viewing the tables using the `\dt` command.
```
psql -U vmsadmin -d vms -h localhost -W
```
```
\dt
```
There needs to be at least one organization in the `organization_organization` table in order to register for an account (this be changed later). Add Google as an organization:

    insert into organization_organization values (1, 'Google');

Make sure to exit the postgres client before proceeding to the next steps:

    \q

## Change Directory Permissions

You will have to change the permissions on the **/srv** directory to read, write and execute (**/srv** is the directory where Volunteer resumes are uploaded and stored). To do this, run the following command:

    sudo chmod 777 /srv

## Run Development Server

Change directory to where you can find the **manage.py** file (this is located in the top level directory for the project).

Start the development server by running the command (this runs the development server on the VM):

    python manage.py runserver [::]:8000

You can now try out the project by going to [http://localhost:8001/home](http://localhost:8001/home) on a browser on your local machine.

## Run Unit Tests

You can also run unit tests by running the command:

    python manage.py test name_of_app_here

For example, in the project, there are Django apps called volunteer, job, shift and organization. You can run tests for these apps individually by running these commands separately:
```
python manage.py test volunteer
```
```
python manage.py test job
```
```
python manage.py test shift
```
```
python manage.py test organization
```

If you want to run all unit tests, run this command:

    python manage.py test

Once you are done with testing out and running the project, you may want to exit the VM and suspend or shut it down by running these commands:

Exit out of the ssh session with the VM by running:

    exit

To put the VM in suspend mode, run the command:

    vagrant suspend

Alternatively, to shut down the VM, run the command:

    vagrant halt
